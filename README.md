# Ruby-Tamagotchi

Goal
Our goal for this project was to create a virtual pet using the Ruby programming language. The user takes care of a virtual pet by feeding the pet, taking it out on walks, and brushing the pet. If the pet’s health gets below 0 then the pet will die and the game will be over. 


User Manual 

Installing Ruby: 
Step 1: Visit https://rubyinstaller.org/ and click the “Download” button.
Step 2: Check which version they recommend and download that version.
Step 3: Once downloaded accept the license once read through
Step 4: Click “install” once this screen pops up.
Step 5: This screen should pop up once the installation is complete. Click “Finish”
Step 6: This screen should pop up after clicking the “finish” button. You have the option to click “Enter” or just exit out of this if you do not need the components listed
Step 7: After exiting out of the previous screen open up “Start Command Prompt with Ruby”
Step 8: This will be your starting screen.
Step 9: The first thing you want to do is change your directory. Use the command “cd C:\Ruby26-x64\lib\ruby\site_ruby\2.6.0”. In our case we found the path that we wanted to end up at.
Step 10: Once you have changed your directory you need to make a folder where you will keep all of your ruby files (not necessary but recommended). Type the command “mkdir name-of-folder”
Step 11: Once you have created a new folder you need to change the directory again into that folder. Type the command “cd name-of-folder’
Step 12: Go into the folder and save the source code file. 

Step 13: Call file but putting the command, Ruby animal.rb
